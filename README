Michael Kelsey's person ~/bin/ directory at Texas A&M HPRC.

These are my personal scripts and utilities for working on the Grace
and FASTER clusters at HPRC.  I have also included my login
environment (.bash_profile, .bashrc, and .aliases) as visible files,
with a home-setup script to create symlinks in my home directory.
The "Cedar_bin" branch has modifications to these scripts for use on the
Compute Canada (DRAC) cluster Cedar.
